<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Similarities between RRR and Naruto </h1>

## Spoilers ahead!
Maybe it's getting repetitive, but I think there are similarities. 
Humor me. 

<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Rama's character and Itachi </h1>

## Itachi
Itachi in Naruto is the most loved character in the series. And toutedly, most feared as well. 
As one of the conversations between Kisame and Itachi themselves claim, that If Itachi went against Jiraya. Both of them would likely die, which is an unfavourable outcome. Now. if a character is strong enough to be as humble and as strong like Itachi, surely it is a well written character.

Here are his few qualities or arc's that are worth mentioning here. 

-  Kind to the core. (Sarutobi sensei approves)
-  Prodigal (Everyone acknowledges this, and has been established multiple times.)
-  Trained by his father.
-  Duty bound. 
-  Killed his own parents. 
-  Slayed his whole clan.
-  Infiltrated the enemy group. (The Akatsuki)
-  Climbed the echelons of the Akatsuki.
-  Lead the double agent life. 

## Rama
Now if we look at Rama's characted in RRR. 

-   Kind.
-   Prodigal. (Sniper like level established during Ajay Devgan's arc)
-   Trained by his father. 
-   Duty bound. 
-   Had to kill his own father. (Ok maybe this one is not similar to Itachi, but still sends the point across.)
-   Kept on trashing Indians, untill he is the supreme officer in British Police.
-   Infiltrated the British Police.
-   Climbed its ranks.
-   Lead the double agent life. 



See what I mean?
Maybe Rajmoulli was also inspired from Naruto, or maybe it just so happens to be a parallel without him knowing about it.
Who knows. 

In anycase, I was also very fascinated by both of these amazing works. Maybe this is what happens when two great writers have a deep understanding of the life of an individual who maybe does the wrong things, but his reasoning is sound and the most honourable of causes.
