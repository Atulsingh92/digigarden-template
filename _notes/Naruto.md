## The reason Naruto is my favourite Anime.
Where do I even begin. 
The first time I saw Naruto, (the Anime), I wasn't very sure to continue as the series seemed long and every other series is more often than not, long. This was no different. But a man's gotta eat, and these days, a man's gotta watch something while eating. Otherwise, the loneliness takes a part of you away. Perhaps this is why the distraction helps. 

Turns out Naruto itself ended up being, in parts, about loneliness. Or rather abject loneliness. The one which makes you watch the world around you passively. The one which is a therapy in itself, but only to a certain extent. The one which slowly makes you grow, as you start to see the world around you in a much better way. Perhaps this is why I ended up liking Naruto so much, after all the boy wins over his loneliness, and boy, does he win. 

## The hook. 

Honestly, the starting was just amazing, a new world introduced, with a nine-tail fox wreaking havoc on a village. I have multiple opinion about this, but just lets go with a man's ego unleashed to a tranquil environement. The wake of which takes the peace of mind of the villagers and the village itself. 
However, it was not untill the Rock Lee Vs Gaara fight, that I was hooked. 
It also comes at the most prime point of the series, just 8-9 episodes in. The reason is pretty simple perhaps. Once you have the characters introduced, the first thing you make do with your characters is jut pit them against each other. 
But Kishimoto of course does this in style. He not only introduces the characters of Konoha, but also the characters from the other villages, and the long-existing tensions between the villages. Something that has always remain true with the current geo-political situation. While the "current" can still change over time. The geo-political situations in them wouldn't.
