<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Mahabharat </h1>

## Some insights from the lens of Astrology.
- Jyotish created by Parashar whose son, Ved Vyas, wrote the Mahabharat. Obviously both are strong characters within the story. 
- Parashar knew something (could see the future, literally) -> leading to him going to Satyawati and impregnating Satyawati with Ved Vyaas. (Who later fathered Pandu , Dhritrirashtra and Vidura)
- Ved Vyaas by extrapolation should also be able to see the future, as this can be judged based on two instances. One when he alerts Draupadi to take care of her hair. And second, when he takes Satyawati, Amba and Ambalika back to the forests, becuase they won't be able to see what will come to pass within the court of Dhritrastra (Draupadi vastr haran.)

- A theorem in jyotish says that a person born with a very strong Sun influence, will connect to the government, no matter how poor he is born. This connection could manifest in several ways. For instance, his/her father could be a government official, or in the future, him/her citizenship request to a different country is accepted. There are many such manifestaion examples. 
- In Mahabharat, we observe Karna, who is a Surya putr himself, is described to be very radiant (Sun), is a huge giver of alms (a king like trait, also governed by a Sun influence). And ends up becoming a king of a small nation (Ang), and of course, walks and talks with the who's who of the states person of those times. 

- Traitswise, Sun is always willing to "expand" and doesn't understand the nittiy gritty of politics. This is also observed in Karna as he keeps telling Duryodhan to beat Pandavs in battlefield like a true warrior and not through tricks.
- 
- By deductive logic, conversely, someone being a statesman and with a strong sun, could also mean that he/she is somewhat descendant of the Sun dynasty or is connected to the lineage of the same, or else, why would the Sun bless him with his abundance. (?)

- Being celibate will give you powers second to none (Bheeshm), but will most likely make the journey sadder, as if you are being tested. And you will be, time and again. But if you succeed, Narayan himself will free you from the cycle of life and death.
