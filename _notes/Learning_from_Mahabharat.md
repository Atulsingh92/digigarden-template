<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Mahabharat </h1>

## Some insights from the lens of Astrology (created by Parashar) whose son, Ved Vyas, wrote the Mahabharat. 
- Parashar knew something (could see the future, literally) -> leading to him going to Satyawati and impregnating Satyawati with Ved Vyaas. (Who later gave birth to Pandu , Dhritrirashtra and Vidura)
- Ved vyaas by extrapolation should also be able to see future and seen in two instances. One when he alerts Draupadi to take care of her hair. And second, when he takes Satyawati, Amba and Ambalika back to the forests, becuase they won't be able to see what will come to pass within the darbar of Dhritrastra (Draupadi vastr haran.)
- 
- Sun is always willing to "expand" and doesn't understand the nittiy gritty of politics (Karna always telling Duryodhan to beat Pandavs in battlefield and not through tricks.)
- Someone strong with sun, walks, talks and lives with who's who of the state. (Karna again, regardless of being a "percieved" outsider.)
- By deductive logic, someone being in the statesman and with a strong sun, could mean is somewhat descendant of the Sun dynasty (?)

- Being celibate will give you powers second to none (Bheeshm), but will most likely make the journey sadder, as if you are being tested. And you will be, time and again. But if you succeed, Narayan himself will free you from the cycle of life and death.
