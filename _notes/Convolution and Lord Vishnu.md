<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Convolution </h1>

-	f(x)
-	g(x)
-	g(s-x)
-	Sigma 0 to 1 f(x) g(s-x)
-	Take any function and convolve with any other function, the resulting function is the moving average of the two. Where the moving window=s
-	Look up 3b1b video on convolution and revisit the idea.
-	Basically a mountain is created in both the dimensions. 
-	The first is f(x) and the second is g(s-x). 
-	Slice of this mountain and the area under the curve from the slice of this mountain times root 2 gives the convolution value
-	All the convolution eventually tends to a gaussian (std may be different)
-	repeated convolvs also tend to gaussians

<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Lord Vishnu </h1>
-	Vishvam = Originator/ everything/ all / ultimate
-	There are other 1000 names but most of which refer to this "energy signature" as the ultimate being
-	Also true from Geeta = He is the ultimate truth, and after the cycles of birth and death, lucky ones getting out of this cycle tend to "Parm-Atma" or the ultimate soul
-	It is also said, that Param-aatma is he, and every living being is going through the cycle of life and birth, to eventually tend to the originator of aatama, that is lord vishnu.
-	This is of course on a larger time scale, and not comprehensible by an individual living only 70 or years on the planet, but 70 years, on the frame of time in general is perhaps even smaller than the scale of time itself.
