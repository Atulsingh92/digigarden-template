<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Convolution </h1>

-	f(x)
-	g(x)
-	g(s-x)
-	Sigma 0 to 1 f(x) g(s-x)
-	Take any function and convolve with any other function, the resulting function is the moving average of the two. Where the moving window=s
-	Look up 3b1b video on convolution and revisit the idea.
-	Basically a mountain is created in both the dimensions. 
-	The first is f(x) and the second is g(s-x). 
-	Slice of this mountain and the area under the curve from the slice of this mountain times root 2 gives the convolution value
-	All the convolution eventually tends to a gaussian (std may be different)
-	repeated convolvs also tend to gaussians

<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Lord Vishnu </h1>
-	Vishvam = Originator/ everything/ all / ultimate.
-	There are other 1000 names but most of which refer to this "energy signature" as the ultimate being.
-	Also true from Geeta = He is the ultimate truth, and after the cycles of birth and death, lucky ones getting out of this cycle tend to "Parm-Atma" or the ultimate soul.
-	It is also said, that Param-aatma is he, and every living being is going through the cycle of life and birth, to eventually tend to the originator of aatama, that is lord vishnu.
-	This is of course on a larger time scale, and not comprehensible by an individual living only 70 or years on the planet, but 70 years, on the frame of time in general is perhaps even smaller than the scale of time itself.

<h1 style="text-align: center;">The idea </h1>

-   Man is f
-   Woman is g or rather (s-x). This is based on the fact that man + woman - is the total, or as considered in hindu traditions as one. 
-   Shanti path too says the same, that 
    poornam adam, poornam idam, puurnaat puurna mudachyate,
    poornasya poornam aadaaya, puurna meva vashishyate
-   This translates to , "This is whole, that is whole, the one that comes out is also whole. 
    When you take half from the whole, the thing that remains is also whole. 
-   What this translates to , is that Man is whole, a woman is whole, the baby, created from the union, as small and tiny it may seem, but it is also whole. 
-   On the contrary, the same applies to an amoeba, and at a cellular level. i.e. A cell is in itself a whole. 
-   The one the leads to division, and the two cells created out of the division, are infact complete in itself, and are whole. 


-   Now, if we combine the two, a man is just a function convolved with a woman, to create a new function. Each of these three, are in fact the complete function in themselves, perhaps a bit wavy or curvy (if you mind my pun) or perhaps edgy. 
-   The baby or the output of the convolution, is the sum total of its parent (again, if you mind my pun) function. 
-   Or rather, the man is convolving with the moving average window that is a woman, that comes in a man's life (or vice versa), to create a new being, or the convolved output.
-   Once the being or the baby is in the mortal plane (lets say the first generation), it is (or rather has to) be away from the ultimate truth of being a Gaussian (Vishnu). 
-   More subsequent convolvs, that is the first generation moving to the second, moving to the third, slowly would give a Gaussian (Vishnu.).
-   Hence, man is infact tending towards the ultimate, or towards the manager of the world, that is Lord Vishnu.
